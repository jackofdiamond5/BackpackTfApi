# Backpack.Tf Api


[Backpack.Tf Api](https://github.com/jackofdiamond5/BackpackTfApi) is a project that provides wrapper models and utility classes for easier management for the [backpack.tf](https://backpack.tf) API endpoints. Built with the mindset of being useful for all sorts of applications, it lives to serve the following goals:
- Be easy to use and understand
- Be well documented
- Unify all API endpoints and provide simple handlers
- Provide simple ways of serialization and deserialization
- Internally handle all API calls but also expose functionality for custom implementations
- Offer simple ways of handling the various responses and transform them into .NET types
